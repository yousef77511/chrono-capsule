                <p>
                    Chrono Capsule is a time-traveling message vault — a place where you can write to the future, lock your thoughts, and let them unlock when the time is right. Whether it’s a birthday wish, a note to your future self, a surprise for a friend, or a memory sealed in digital amber, Chrono Capsule helps you preserve moments that matter.<br /><br />Built with care, curiosity, and a sprinkle of nostalgia, this project is a tribute to time, memory, and the magic of waiting.

                <p>
                    Hi, I’m <strong>Puneet Gopinath</strong> — a developer, designer, and digital timekeeper. I created Chrono Capsule to explore the intersection of emotion and technology — and to build something that feels personal, purposeful, and a little poetic.<br /><br />When I’m not coding, I’m probably sketching ideas, chasing clean UI, or thinking about how software can feel more human.<br /><br />You can find more of my work on <a href="https://github.com/PuneetGopinath" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a> or reach out if you want to collaborate, chat, or send a message to the future.
